# Plane Wave Propagation in a Non-Dispersive Medium (3D Finite Difference Time Domain Methods)

* This repository provides a MATLAB implementation of the 3D Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method for simulating the propagation of plane electromagnetic waves in a non-dispersive medium. The FDTD method is a robust and versatile numerical technique for solving Maxwell's equations in the time domain, ideal for studying electromagnetic wave interactions in various media.

## Features
* 3D FDTD Simulation: Implements a full three-dimensional FDTD algorithm to model plane wave propagation in a non-dispersive medium.
* Non-Dispersive Medium Modeling: Simulates wave propagation in media where the wave velocity is constant and independent of frequency.
* User-Friendly MATLAB Code: Provides well-documented and modular MATLAB scripts, ensuring ease of use and modification.
* Visualization Tools: Includes functions to visualize electric and magnetic field distributions over time, allowing for detailed analysis of wave behavior.
* Customizable Parameters: Allows users to adjust simulation parameters such as grid size, time steps, and source properties.
